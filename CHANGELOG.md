## [Unreleased](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy-ios/compare/0.3.0...HEAD)

### Added
- Added an `UpdateStrategy` to `CollectionView` to allow specifying that it should update using non-
  animated `performBatchUpdates(â€¦)`, which can be more performant and behave more predictably than
  `reloadData()`.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy-ios/compare/0.3.0...0.4.0) - 2021-05-17

### Added
- Added an example with text field to show how can we use `avoidsKeyboard` feature
- Add EpoxyLayoutGroups, a declarative API for creating components

### Fixed
- `AnyItemModel` is selectable when there are no `DidSelect` callbacks on the underlying model

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy-ios/compare/0.2.0...0.3.0) - 2021-04-23

### Added
- Added support for `Array` and `Optional` expressions to model result builders
- Added support for `Optional` expressions to `PresentationModel` result builders
- Made `AnyItemModel` and `AnySupplementaryItemModel` conform to `DidChangeStateProviding`,
  `DidChangeStateProviding` and `SetBehaviorsProviding`
- Made `AnyItemModel`, `AnySupplementaryItemModel`, and `AnyBarModel` conform to `StyleIDProviding`
- Adds a `keyboardContentInsetAdjustment` property to `UIScrollView` with the amount that the that
  its `contentInset.bottom` has been adjusted to accommodate for the keyboard by a
  `KeyboardPositionWatcher`
- Made `ItemSelectionStyle` conform to `Hashable`
- `ReuseIDStore` has a new method to vend a previously registered reuse ID,
  `registeredReuseID(for:)`

### Fixed
- Bar installers gracefully handle redundant calls to install/uninstall
- `CollectionView` more gracefully handles styleID mutations after registration

### Changed
- `ReuseIDStore.registerReuseID(for:)` has been renamed to `ReuseIDStore.reuseID(byRegistering:)`

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy-ios/compare/0.1.0...0.2.0) - 2021-03-16

### Added
- Added result builders for `SectionModel`, `ItemModel`, `BarModel`, `PresentationModel`, and
  `NavigationModel`
- Added initializers and methods to `CollectionViewController` that take an array of `ItemModel`s
  and transparently wrap them in a `SectionModel` for consumers.

### Changed
- Updated public let properties of public structs with memberwise initializers to be public var
- `BarStackView` now handles selection of bar models and can be used as an `EpoxyableView`
- The cases of `BarStackView.ZOrder` have been renamed to be more semantically accurate
- Enables `CollectionView` prefetching by default, as the issues preventing it from being enabled by
  default are now resolved in recent iOS versions
- Support animated moves in `BarStackView`
- Fixed ordering when inserting and removing bar models
- Crossfade between bars of the same view type with different style IDs in `BarStackView`

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy-ios/compare/171f63da...0.1.0) - 2021-02-01
