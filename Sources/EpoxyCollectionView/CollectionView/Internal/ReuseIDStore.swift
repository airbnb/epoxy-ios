/// identifier whenever a new combination is encountered.
///
/// For example, if we encounter a `TitleRow` with a style ID of `{ font: .black }`, then we encounter another
/// `TitleRow` with a style ID of `{ font: .green }`, then we encounter one last `TitleRow` with a style ID of
/// `{ font: .black }`, 2 reuse identifiers are created:
/// 1. `"TitleRow_0"` (for `TitleRow` + `{ font: .black }`)
/// 2. `"TitleRow_1"` (for `TitleRow` + `{ font: .green }`)
